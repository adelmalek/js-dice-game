# GAME RULES

- 2 players
- Each round, the players roll the dice as many times as they wish.
  The result of each roll is added to the player's score for that round.
- If the players roll 1, all of their points are lost and they pass the roll to the other player.
- The players can also select the 'KEEP' button.
  In this case, the number of points in that round will be added to the player's total points.
  The roll then passes to the other player.
- The player who reaches 100 points first wins.
